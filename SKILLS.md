# Development skill library

This index contains 500 practical development skills for Chron. Entries are grouped by the exact category allocations in `PLAN.md`; IDs run consecutively from S001 to S500. Select a relevant skill before significant work and apply its implementation and verification guidance. Security notes describe the risk specific to that skill.

Each record includes Skill ID, Name, Purpose, When to use, Implementation approach, Recommended tools, Security considerations, and Verification method.

This is development guidance, not user-facing product content. Do not ship samples, placeholders, stubs, fake demos, or seeded product records. Synthetic fixtures are test-only and must never be bundled into the application.

## Frontend engineering

### S001 — Server/client component boundaries

- **Skill ID:** S001
- **Name:** Server/client component boundaries
- **Purpose:** Keep browser-only state out of server-rendered modules
- **When to use:** When a route mixes private data loading and interactive controls
- **Implementation approach:** Fetch protected data in server components; isolate event handlers in small client leaves
- **Recommended tools:** Next.js App Router, React, TypeScript
- **Security considerations:** Never serialize credentials or authorization decisions into client props
- **Verification method:** Build route fixtures and assert private fields are absent from rendered payloads

### S002 — Route segment loading states

- **Skill ID:** S002
- **Name:** Route segment loading states
- **Purpose:** Make slow route transitions communicate progress without layout jumps
- **When to use:** When a page streams data or waits on a nested segment
- **Implementation approach:** Place loading boundaries at the segment that owns the pending work; reserve final geometry
- **Recommended tools:** Next.js loading.tsx, React Suspense
- **Security considerations:** Do not reveal whether another user’s resource exists through loading text
- **Verification method:** Throttle requests in browser and compare fallback geometry with resolved content

### S003 — Route-level error boundaries

- **Skill ID:** S003
- **Name:** Route-level error boundaries
- **Purpose:** Contain recoverable rendering failures to the affected page area
- **When to use:** When a feature can fail independently of global navigation
- **Implementation approach:** Use an error boundary per route segment with a safe retry action and sanitized message
- **Recommended tools:** Next.js error.tsx, React Error Boundary
- **Security considerations:** Keep stack traces and server response bodies out of the UI
- **Verification method:** Force a segment exception and confirm navigation remains usable
